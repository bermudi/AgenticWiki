H LongMemEvalS Full Results
The main paper summarizes LongMemEvalS ac-
curacy across storage budgets. Table 8 reports
the full type-level results across all budgets.
LongMemEvalS contains 60 questions, with 10
questions per type. Accuracy is judged using GPT-
4o-mini.

I Full Scaled LoCoMo-style Results

The main paper reports scaled LoCoMo-style re-
sults as a storage–performance curve. Table 9 pro-
vides the full numerical values for the 3x and 10x
settings.

J Scaled LoCoMo-style Dataset Details

We construct scaled LoCoMo-style datasets to eval-
uate memory compression under longer conversa-
tional histories. Because the scaled datasets are
synthetically generated, we verify that they pre-
serve the broad structure of the original benchmark
while increasing conversation length and redun-
dancy. Table 10 summarizes their basic statistics,
text-level diversity indicators, and QA category dis-
tributions. The 3x setting is a relatively faithful
scaled version of LoCoMo, while the 10x setting
serves as a stronger stress test with longer and more
repetitive interaction histories.

K Artifact Licenses and Use

We use publicly available research artifacts only for
research and evaluation. LoCoMo is released under

to benchmark evaluation and method comparison,
and we do not redistribute the original benchmark
data or framework code as part of this paper. The
scaled LoCoMo-style datasets are synthetic stress-
test variants constructed for analysis of longer con-
versational histories.

Table 9: Full MEMREFINE results on scaled LoCoMo-style datasets. The 3x and 10x settings contain approximately
three and ten times longer conversations than standard LoCoMo, respectively. Node or entry counts are reported as
the average number of stored memory units after compression.
