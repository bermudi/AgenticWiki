        Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software devel-
opment, widely used for requirements engineering, code generation and review
tasks. Software engineers often rely on LLMs to verify if code implementation
satisfy task requirements, thereby ensuring code robustness and accuracy. How-
ever, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably determine code against the
given task descriptions, which is usually in a form of natural language specifica-
tions. In this paper, we uncover a systematic failure of LLMs in matching code
to natural language requirements. Specifically, with widely adopted benchmarks
and unified prompts design, we demonstrate that LLMs frequently misclassify
correct code implementation as non-compliant or defective. Surprisingly, we find
that more detailed prompt design, particularly with those requiring explanations
and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rates, highlighting critical
reliability issues for LLM-based code assistants. We further analyze the mech-
anisms driving these failures and evaluate the reliability of rationale-required
judgments. Building on these findings, we propose a Fix-guided Verification Fil-
ter that treats the model proposed fix as executable counterfactual evidence, and
validates the original and revised implementations using benchmark tests and
spec-constrained augmented tests. Our results expose previously under-explored
limitations in LLM-based code review capabilities, and provide practical guid-
ance for integrating LLM-based reviewers with safeguards in automated review
and development pipelines.

1 Introduction

As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated increasing capability in the
domain of code synthesis [1], a growing body of research and tooling efforts have
begun exploring their application for automated code review and verification [2–4].
Traditional code reviews require developers to manually verify the alignment between
code logic and requirements, a process that is both time consuming and prone to
human error. LLMs show significant potential to reduce this burden by automat-
ing code assessments and suggesting improvements during the code-review process.
For instance, recent studies have leveraged models such as GPT-4o to evaluate code
submissions and determine whether they meet quality standards or require revisions
[5].
   In software engineering, verifying and validating that source code aligns with its
task requirements remains a challenge [6]. Requirements engineering is widely recog-
nized as crucial to clearly defining, understanding, and aligning project objectives with
stakeholder needs, thereby reducing risks associated with errors, delays, and project
failures [7]. Recent studies start to investigate the potential of LLMs to bridge this gap.
Advanced models such as GPT-4o have shown promising accuracy in identifying unmet
requirements from textual descriptions [8], indicating their potential as reliable “vir-
tual reviewers” even without test cases or formal implementations. To further improve
review effectiveness, researchers have explored self-critical mechanisms within LLMs,
such as the Self-Refine framework, where models iteratively critique and refine their
outputs without additional training [9]. Ideally, LLMs should accurately understand
functional requirements described in natural language and reliably judge whether pro-
vided code satisfies these requirements, assisting developers in identifying defects or
confirming correctness. However, in scenarios lacking test cases or reference implemen-
tations, the reliability of LLMs in performing such “description-to-code” evaluations
remains unclear.
   A common intuition is that richer prompting improves reliability: asking the LLM
to explain its decision, enumerate mismatches, or propose fixes should encourage more
careful reasoning [10]. Nevertheless, LLMs are known to exhibit hallucinations and sys-
tematic biases [11], and prompt “enhancements” may unintentionally shift the model’s
error profile rather than uniformly improving accuracy. In particular, more elaborate
prompts can amplify an LLM’s tendency to over-criticize correct code or to rational-
ize incorrect decisions with persuasive-but-unfaithful explanations. This motivates a
key question for automated review: Do prompt variants trade false rejection for false
acceptance, and are the generated rationales themselves trustworthy?
   To answer these questions, we investigate whether LLMs can correctly determine
code correctness when provided with precise task descriptions and correct imple-
mentations. Specifically, we conduct a large-scale empirical investigation across three
widely used programming benchmarks under three prompting approaches. We eval-
uate five representative LLMs (three closed-source and two open-source) and report
full confusion-matrix statistics. Beyond decision accuracy, we further examine the reli-
ability of the explanation along two complementary dimensions. Finally, we proposed
a filter-embedded framework to assess their usefulness in reducing such bias. Our
experiments reveal a concerning phenomenon: LLMs frequently issue false negative

judgments, incorrectly concluding that correct implementations fail to meet stated
requirements, resulting in a high false negative rate. Surprisingly, our extended exper-
iments involving various prompt designs indicate that increasing prompt complexity,
such as requiring explicit explanations and suggested corrections, counterintuitively
leads to higher rates of misjudgment, this finding contradicts the common assumption
that incorporating explanatory steps typically enhances the reasoning and accuracy of
LLMs [12, 13]. Instead, detailed prompts may inadvertently introduce biases toward
excessive fault finding, causing models to detect non-existent errors in otherwise
correct implementations.
     Our findings have direct implications for deploying LLMs as automated review-
ers: even when an LLM can frequently “pass” correct solutions, it may simultaneously
suffer from severe over-correction (high FN) and unsafe acceptance (high FP), and
the accompanying explanations may not faithfully justify the decision. These limi-
tations can undermine the utility and trustworthiness of LLM-based review systems
[14, 15], especially in automated pipelines where a model’s judgement may trigger
or block downstream actions [16], unreliable assessments will compromise the overall
effectiveness of automated engineering workflow. Therefore, understanding why LLMs
systematically misjudge correct implementations and identifying strategies to mitigate
these failures becomes crucial, by providing these novel insights, we aim to raise com-
munity awareness regarding the limitations of LLMs in code evaluation. In summary,
this work makes the following contributions:
1. False negatives discovery - We reveal that LLMs frequently misjudge correct
    code as failing to meet requirements, indicating their bias towards over-correction
    rather than accurate verification.
2. Bias characterization across prompts and five models - We quantify over-
    correction bias and false acceptance under three prompting approaches and five
    LLMs, revealing prompt-induced tradeoffs and decision instabilities.
3. Self-consistency and Fault-awareness - We introduce and evaluate an
    explanation-centric consistency measure that captures contradiction between model


                                     3

   verdicts and their rationales, also we evaluate whether LLM rationales reflect fault-
   aware reasoning, and analyze how false acceptance concentrates on specific bug
   types.
4. Exploratory mitigation analysis - We explore mitigation strategies to assess
   their effectiveness in reducing judgement biases.

2 Background and Related Work
2.1 LLMs for code review
Modern code review is a cornerstone of current software development, serving as a
primary quality check for defect discovery, maintainability, and knowledge transfer.
Empirical work has characterized both the expected benefits and the practical fric-
tions of review, highlighting that “review quality” depends not only on correctness
detection but also on how reviewers interpret requirements and communicate action-
able feedback [17–19]. Against this backdrop, learning-based code intelligence has
rapidly evolved from task specific neural models to general purpose pre-trained mod-
els for code and natural language. Encoder based and encoder-decoder models such
as CodeBERT [20], GraphCodeBERT [21], and CodeT5 [22] established strong base-
lines for code understanding and generation tasks (e.g., summarization, translation,
and defect-related reasoning), and provide the representational foundations that later
large language models build upon. These capabilities enable an emerging class of LLM-
assisted reviewing scenarios, where models are used to summarize changes, propose
edits, and explain behavioral implications as part of review.
   More recently, code specialized LLMs have demonstrated strong synthesis and
editing capabilities, motivating their use as “virtual reviewers” that can generate
explanations and suggest repairs. Representative systems and models include Codex
style evaluation on HumanEval [23], competition-level synthesis with AlphaCode
[24], and open code LLMs such as CodeGen, InCoder, and CodeLlama [25–27]. In
parallel, software engineering benchmarks targeting real-world issue resolution (e.g.,
SWE-bench) further illustrate the community’s interest in using LLMs for end-to-
end debugging and patching workflows [28]. Our work connects to this trajectory but
targets a distinct point in the review pipeline: requirement-conformance judgement
without executing tests, and the systematic biases that arise when prompts elicit
explanations and fixes.

2.2 Reliability issues in code tasks
A substantial body of work has evaluated LLM capability in code tasks via curated
benchmarks with executable tests or reference outputs, such as HumanEval, MBPP,
APPS, MultiPL-E, and QuixBugs [23, 29–32]. These benchmarks have been instru-
mental in quantifying functional correctness under test-based evaluation and enabling
fair comparisons across models. However, they also highlight a practical gap: many real
code review settings do not provide comprehensive tests or formal specifications, and
“correctness” must be assessed from a natural-language requirement and code alone.



    4

In such settings, the key risk is not only incorrect code generation, but also unreli-
able code assessment, models may reject correct implementations (false rejection) or
accept buggy ones (false acceptance) when reasoning is unconstrained by execution.
   Reliability concerns in LLM-based reasoning systems have been widely discussed in
terms of hallucination, overconfidence, and specification drift, where models produce
plausible but unsupported claims [11, 33, 34]. For code-related tasks, these risks are
amplified because models can (i) infer non-existent constraints, (ii) speculate about
runtime failures without evidence, or (iii) overfit to stylistic “best practices” that are
orthogonal to requirement satisfaction. Moreover, the security community has shown
that LLM-generated code can introduce vulnerabilities, which raises the stakes of
inaccurate review judgements in practice [35].
   Prompting and self-improvement strategies have been proposed to increase rea-
soning quality, including chain-of-thought prompting, zero-shot “think step-by-step”
prompting, and self-consistency sampling [36–38]. Iterative refinement and agen-
tic approaches (e.g., Self-Refine and Reflexion) further attempt to improve outputs
through critique and feedback cycles [39, 40]. Related prompting frameworks such as
ReAct and prompt-pattern catalogs systematize how to elicit reasoning and tool use
[10, 41]. While these approaches can improve performance in many settings, they also
introduce new failure modes (e.g., longer rationales that drift from the requirement,
or “fixes” that reflect overly conservative assumptions).

2.3 LLMs judge and bias
LLM-based evaluators (“LLM-as-a-judge”) have become a common mechanism for
scalable assessment of model outputs, particularly in open-ended generation where
reference-based metrics are weak [42]. Benchmarking frameworks such as MT-Bench
and Chatbot Arena operationalize pairwise preference evaluation using strong LLM
judges [43], and have been influential in tracking model quality trends [44]. More
fine-grained LLM-based evaluation protocols, such as G-Eval, propose rubric-style
prompting to increase alignment with human judgements [5]. In code-specific settings,
recent work has also explored prompt-based ”judge” formulations for code correctness
decisions, illustrating the appeal of LLM judges when unit tests are unavailable or
incomplete [45]. However, a growing literature warns that LLM judges can be system-
atically biased and vulnerable. For example, evaluators may exhibit self-preference or
other forms of comparative bias, favoring outputs that resemble their own generations
rather than outputs that best satisfy the underlying task [16]. More broadly, work
on red-teaming language models emphasizes that model behavior can be manipulated
through prompt framing and adversarial or leading instructions, which is directly rel-
evant when judgements are elicited via structured prompts that request explanations
and fixes [46].

3 Methodology
3.1 Research Question
To investigate the reliability, bias patterns, and practical implications of LLM-based
requirement conformance judgement without test cases, we propose the following
research questions:
• RQ1: Without test cases, to what extent can LLMs reliably assess whether a
  program conforms to its specification?
• RQ2: How does prompt design affect the LLM-based conformance judgement?
  In particular, does increasing prompt complexity introduce a systematic tradeoff
  between false rejection and false acceptance, and how often do decisions flip across
  prompting modes?
• RQ3: What mechanisms drive false acceptance and false rejection? Specifically,
  (i) are false positives concentrated on particular bug categories (bug type / fail-
  ure symptoms), and (ii) do false negatives exhibit recurring patterns in the model’s
  rejection rationales that can be summarized by a unified taxonomy?
• RQ4: How reliable are the explanations produced under rationale-required
  prompts? whether the rationale supports the stated YES/NO verdict, and the
  rationale aligns with known bug categories and failure symptoms?
• RQ5: What factors cause LLMs to incorrectly classify correct code as faulty, and
  can these misjudgments be effectively mitigated?
These research questions cover three key dimensions: understanding the root causes
of LLMs’ misjudgments, exploring potential mitigation solutions, and evaluating their
effectiveness.

3.2 Datasets and Construction
To enable reliability analysis of requirement conformance judgement, we require paired
data that contains both correct and buggy implementations. We construct a unified
benchmark suite based on three widely-used code evaluation benchmarks: HumanEval
[23], MBPP [29], and QuixBugs [32]. In total, these benchmarks provide over 700 tasks
for evaluation; after pairing each task with both a correct and a buggy implementation,
the final dataset contains over 1400 instances. For each task, we create two aligned
variants sharing the same requirement text: (1) a canonical (correct) implementation
with label 1, and (2) a buggy implementation with label 0. This paired design ensures
that false rejection (FN) and false acceptance (FP) can be computed consistently
across tasks, prompts, and models, rather than only measuring recognition of correct
code.

HumanEval-X-Bugs (paired HumanEval).
For HumanEval, we adopt HumanEval-X-Bugs (from HumanEvalPack [47]), which
provides both a canonical solution and a corresponding buggy solution for each task.
Each record includes the natural-language task description and the function dec-
laration, enabling us to construct complete Python implementations. Importantly,


    6

HumanEval-X-Bugs additionally provides structured labels describing the injected
fault, including bug type and failure symptoms.

Buggy-MBPP construction.
MBPP [29] originally provides task descriptions and correct reference implementations.
To support false acceptance analysis, we prepare a paired buggy version of MBPP
using an existing bug-aware corpus that provides buggy solution prompts. Since some
buggy data is not released as a standalone complete function body, we reconstruct
full buggy implementations by combining the buggy prefix/body with the remaining
part of the canonical solution, while preserving the same function signature and the
overall structure. This yields syntactically complete buggy implementations that are
aligned with the original requirements. We further normalize the fault labels into a
shared schema so that MBPP, HumanEval-X-Bugs, and QuixBugs can be compared
under the same categories.

QuixBugs paired construction.
QuixBugs [32] contains algorithmic problems with known defects and corresponding
corrected implementations. We use the corrected version as the canonical implemen-
tation and the defective version as the buggy implementation, paired under the same
requirement text. Because QuixBugs does not always provide unified fine-grained fault
labels in the same form as HumanEval-X-Bugs, we annotate each buggy instance
with (i) a normalized bug type and (ii) a failure symptoms label using a standard-
ized labeling protocol, and then map them into the same schema used for the other
benchmarks.

Unified schema and label normalization.
To support consistent aggregation and cross-benchmark analysis, we convert all
three datasets into a unified JSON/JSONL schema with fields such as: task id,
requirement (or text), variant (canonical/buggy), label (1/0), code, and (for
buggy instances) bug type and failure symptoms. Across datasets, we normalize
bug type into a shared set of six coarse categories (e.g., missing logic, excess logic,
operator misuse, variable misuse, value misuse, function misuse), and normalize
failure symptoms into a compact set describing observable failure modes (e.g., incor-
rect output, runtime error, non-termination). To facilitate reproducibility, we make
the curated datasets and scripts publicly available at https://github.com/HollinJ31

-Conformance-Judgement.

3.3 Experiment Setup
To address RQ1 and RQ2, we designed a series of experiments to evaluate the
performance of different LLMs on code requirement conformance tasks and to ana-
lyze the impact of prompt design. Regarding model selection, we evaluated five
LLMs, including three mainstream closed-source models and two representative open-
source models. The closed-source models are GPT-4o, Claude-4.5-sonnet, and Google


    7

Gemini-2.0-flash. These models were chosen as representatives of state-of-the-art
industry LLMs, recognized for their strong general purpose capabilities in code under-
standing and generation tasks. Their superior performance makes them promising
candidates for automated code review [48–50]. However, precisely because of their
capabilities, we aimed to examine if they exhibit consistent error patterns under
requirement-conformance judgement. Moreover, these models have consistently been
among the top choices for code review and code synthesis tasks in previous works
[51–53]. To broaden the coverage and improve reproducibility, we further include
two open-source instruction-tuned models: meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct and
mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct. This setting enables a more com-
prehensive comparison between closed-source and open-source LLMs under identical
evaluation protocols.
   Fig 1 summarizes our evaluation pipeline. For each benchmark task, we construct
an input package consisting of (i) the natural-language task specification and (ii) two
code variants: a canonical reference implementation and a buggy implementation with
injected faults, accompanied by the benchmark’s test cases. We then instantiate three
prompting modes, for every instance, we record the model outputs in a structured
JSON format (including verdict, rationale, and fix when available). Finally, we com-
pute outcome statistics by comparing predicted verdicts against the ground-truth label
of each variant (canonical vs. buggy), yielding the confusion matrix and the derived
error measures used in our subsequent analyses.

3.4 Prompt Design
To ensure a fair comparison, we design three prompting approaches under a unified
instruction framework, inspired by recent advances in prompt engineering [41, 54–57].
Each prompt provides the same input information (the natural language requirement
and the code implementation) and differs only in the amount of required intermediate
outputs.

Direct prompt.
The Direct prompt asks the model to read the requirement and the provided code
implementation, and answer a single question: “Does the code meet the requirement?”
The model is instructed to respond with a simple binary answer “Yes” or “No” only.
This prompt represents the minimal setting and serves as a baseline.

Direct + Explain prompt.
The Direct+Explain prompt extends the baseline by additionally requesting a short
rationale for the judgement. Concretely, the model is first asked to output a binary
verdict (“Yes”/“No”), and then provide a brief explanation describing why the code
meets or does not meet the requirement. This setting isolates the effect of requiring
explicit justification, which is commonly believed to encourage more careful reasoning.

Full prompt.
The Full prompt further adopts a three-step structure:


    8

    System Prompts
    You are a senior software engineer specializing in code review and requirement conformance.
    User Prompts
    Below is a requirement describing what a Python function is expected to do: {requirement}
    And here is the implementation of the function: {code}
     Step 1: Conformance Check
     Please ignore any indentation error and lack of type hinting! Does the code satisfy the requirement?
     Answer only with YES or NO.
     Step 2: Justification
     If your answer was NO, explain why the code does not meet the requirement.
     Be specific and refer to particular lines, conditions, or behaviors.
     Step 3: Fix
     If your answer was NO, please fix the code which meet the requirement."

Fig. 2: The Full prompt template used in our experiments. It provides the requirement
and code, then requests a three-step response.

• Judgment: Read the natural language requirement and the provided code imple-
  mentation, then answer the question, “Does the code meet the requirement?” with
  a simple answer “Yes” or “No”.
• Explanation: Request the model to provide a rationale for the judgment, such as
  explaining why it believes the code does not meet the requirements. This covers a
  detailed analysis of any discrepancies between code logic and requirements.
• Fix: If the model judged the code as not meeting the requirement, it was instructed
  to provide corrected code after the explanation. If the code was deemed correct, this
  step could be skipped or explicitly noted as unnecessary.
   Compared to Direct+Explain, the Full prompt introduces an explicit repair
objective, which allows us to examine whether prompting models to “fix” issues may
inadvertently bias them toward over-correction, Fig 2 presents examples of the Full
prompt setting.
   Multi-stage prompting strategies have been applied for code evaluation task, aim-
ing to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs. One common approach first
instructs the model to perform a step-by-step analysis of the code’s functionality,
and then asks it to summarize the analysis with a binary decision (correct or not).
This approach outperforms simple prompts by encouraging LLMs to reason through
both the requirements and the code logic before making a judgment [45]. Such find-
ings provide evidence-based support for our design of structured, explanation-driven
prompting in code evaluation. Similar two-phase prompting method have also been
applied for program repair. For example, [58, 59] prompt LLMs to first generate a
chain-of-thought diagnosis of the bug, followed by providing a patch for fixing. Our
prompt design is aligned with these approaches, in which the model is initially asked

        9

to explain any discrepancies between the code and the requirements, it will use related
reasoning to propose a corrected version of the code if the initial answer is negative.

4 Evaluation Metrics

To address our research questions, our evaluation considers two complementary dimen-
sions: (i) the correctness of LLM judgements against ground-truth labels, and (ii) the
reliability of the generated rationales in explaining and diagnosing failures. To iso-
late the impact of prompt complexity, we evaluate three progressively more complex
prompting strategies: Direct (judgement only), Direct+Explain (judgement with
rationale), and Full (three-step prompt consisting of judgement, explanation, and
suggested repair), we report all metrics for each benchmark, each model, and each
prompt setting.

4.1 Confusion matrix outcomes
With paired canonical/buggy instances (Section 3.2), each instance has a binary
ground-truth label y ∈ {1, 0}, where y = 1 denotes a correct (canonical) implementa-
tion and y = 0 denotes a buggy implementation. Each model outputs a binary verdict
yˆ ∈ {1, 0} parsed from “Yes/No” (“Yes” → 1, “No” → 0), we compute the following
standard outcomes:

        TP = {y = 1 ∧ yˆ = 1}, FN = {y = 1 ∧ yˆ = 0},
        FP = {y = 0 ∧ yˆ = 1}, TN = {y = 0 ∧ yˆ = 0}.

Intuitively, FN captures false rejection (over-correction bias: rejecting correct code),
while FP captures false acceptance (unsafe acceptance: passing buggy code). To explic-
itly characterize these two-sided biases, we primarily report the false negative rate
measures the over-correction tendency on correct implementations (rejecting correct
code) and false positive rate measures unsafe acceptance on buggy implementations
(accepting buggy code), both derived from the confusion matrix. In subsequent anal-
yses, we characterize model behavior primarily through these confusion-matrix counts
together with FNR/FPR under different prompting modes and benchmarks.

4.2 Rejection reason taxonomy
A key challenge in analyzing false negatives is that, unlike false positives on buggy
implementations, FN cases have no ground-truth defect: the implementation is correct
(label 1), yet the LLM rejects it (predicts “No”). Therefore, the provided bug type
labels (which describe injected faults in buggy code) are not applicable to FN analy-
sis. Instead, FN cases are characterized by the model’s claimed rejection reasons in its
rationale, which often reflect systematic over-correction patterns such as requirement
hallucination, overemphasis on edge cases, or unsupported assertions. To systemati-
cally study these rejection rationales across benchmarks, prompting modes, and model
families, we introduce a unified reason taxonomy. Table 1 summarizes the taxonomy
categories used in our study, each FN instance under rationale enabled prompts is

        10

Table 1: FN reason taxonomy for normalizing the main rationale patterns in those
judgments.
 Category              Explanation
 Misread Spec          The model misreads or overlooks key requirement semantics
                       (e.g., interpreting constraint A as constraint B).
 Added Requirement     The model introduces constraints not stated in the requirement
                       and rejects the code for violating these hallucinated requirements.
 Overthink Edge        The model overemphasizes extreme or unspecified edge cases,
                       despite the requirement not mandating such handling (or the
                       code already covering it).
 Assumed Type          The model assumes stricter (or different) input types/formats
                       and rejects the implementation based on those assumptions.
 Imagined Runtime      The model speculates about runtime errors (e.g., index error,
                       None handling, exceptions) without concrete evidence from the
                       given code and requirement.
 Performance Nitpick   The model treats efficiency/complexity as a hard requirement
                       even when not mentioned, and rejects correct code due to
                       perceived inefficiency.
 Readability Nitpick   The model rejects based on style/readability/best-practice
                       concerns rather than functional conformance.
 Precision Error       The model over-concerns floating-point precision/rounding and
                       rejects correct implementations without requirement support.
 Boundary Error        The model claims off-by-one or boundary-condition errors (e.g.,
                       < vs ≤) where the implementation is in fact correct.
 Logic Error           The model broadly claims incorrect algorithm logic or missing
                       steps, often without a falsifiable counterexample.

mapped to exactly one primary category based on the main reason expressed in the raw
rationale, this normalization enables quantitative aggregation and supports further
analysis.
 The taxonomy serves three purposes in our study. First, it enables us to quantify
which rejection patterns dominate FN cases under different prompts (e.g., whether
requiring a “Fix” step increases hallucinated requirements or edge-case overconcern).
Second, it supports cross-model comparisons to identify whether open-source and
closed-source models exhibit different over-correction signatures. Third, it provides a
structured lens for qualitative case studies and for designing bias mitigation explo-
rations, by targeting the most frequent rejection patterns rather than treating all FN
cases as homogeneous.

4.3 A1 Self-consistency Evaluation
While LLMs can output a binary verdict (YES/NO), many prompting approaches
additionally request a rationale. However, in practice, the rationale may not faithfully
support the final verdict [60, 61]. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce self-
consistency, which measures whether an LLM’s written rationale aligns with its

                           11

own stated judgement. A1 is evaluated only for prompting modes that explicitly elicit
rationales, i.e., Direct+Explain and Full. For each evaluated instance, we extract:
(1) a normalized verdict ˆy ∈ {YES, NO} from the model output, and (2) the raw
rationale text (the explanation section in the output).

Evaluator and decision criteria.
We use GPT-4o as an external evaluator to assess whether the rationale supports
the stated verdict, the evaluator is instructed not to judge the code correctness;
instead, it only checks the internal alignment between the verdict and the ratio-
nale. For each (verdict, rationale) pair, the evaluator assigns one of three labels:
consistent, contradiction, or unclear. We additionally record a contradiction
type when contradiction is detected: NO but positive (verdict is NO but ratio-
nale argues the code is correct or compliant), YES but negative (verdict is YES but
rationale argues the code is incorrect or non-compliant), we also ask the model to out-
put their confidence score and short evidence text to support auditing and qualitative
inspection.

4.4 A2 Fault-awareness Evaluation
Beyond internal consistency, a stronger requirement for trustworthy explanations is
fault-awareness: when the implementation is buggy, does the rationale meaningfully
describe the underlying defect and its observable symptoms [60]? To answer this ques-
tion, we introduce A2 fault-awareness, which evaluates whether an LLM rationale
aligns with the ground-truth fault labels provided (or normalized) in our paired buggy
datasets. A2 is evaluated only on buggy instances (label 0) where ground-truth fault
information is available, including a normalized bug type and failure symptoms
(Section 3.2), for each buggy instance, the A2 evaluator receives: (1) the model’s
verdict ˆy, (2) the raw rationale text, (3) the ground-truth bug type, and (4) the
ground-truth failure symptoms. We again use GPT-4o as an external evaluator,
instructed to compare the rationale text against the provided ground-truth labels.
The evaluator does not decide whether the verdict is correct, it assesses whether the
explanation content reflects fault-aware reasoning. For each buggy instance, A2 out-
puts two alignment judgements: one for bug type and one for failure symptoms,
each in: match, mismatch, not mentioned, or unclear. not mentioned indicates the
rationale does not discuss the relevant fault dimension at all (e.g., only restating the
requirement or giving generic comments), while unclear indicates that the rationale
mentions a potential issue but the description is too ambiguous to reliably map to the
ground-truth label.

fewer false rejections of correct implementations (i.e., weaker over-correction bias),
while lower FPR indicates fewer false acceptances of buggy implementations (i.e., less
unsafe acceptance).
 Among the three closed-source models, GPT-4o exhibits the most pronounced over-
correction pattern as prompt complexity increases. Under Direct, GPT-4o achieves
a relatively low FNR in HumanEval (26.2%) and MBPP (35.9%), but once explana-
tions and repairs are required, the FNR increases sharply to 73.2% in HumanEval
and 87.9% in MBPP. Meanwhile, its FPR drops to nearly zero in several settings
(e.g., 0.00% on HumanEval and MBPP under Direct+Explain), suggesting that
the model becomes substantially more conservative, rejecting correct code more often
while rarely accepting buggy code.
 Gemini-2.0-flash shows a comparatively different bias profile: its FNR remains
moderate (roughly in the 22.5%-39.6% range across benchmarks and prompts), but
its FPR is consistently higher than GPT-4o and Claude, especially on QuixBugs
(22.5% under Direct and Direct+Explain). This indicates that Gemini is less
over-correcting than GPT-4o under richer prompts, yet more prone to false acceptance
on buggy implementations. Claude-4.5 generally achieves low FPR (often ≤ 6-7%)
while keeping FNR at a moderate-to-high level depending on the benchmark. Notably,
on HumanEval, Claude-4.5 maintains relatively low FNR under Direct (26.2%) but
increases under Direct+Explain/Full (36.0%). On MBPP and QuixBugs, FNR
remains substantially higher (e.g., 58.5% on MBPP under Direct, increasing to 62.3%

                                           13

under Full), suggesting that for some benchmarks Claude-4.5 also tends toward
over-correction, albeit less extremely than GPT-4o.

  Answer to RQ1: Across three benchmarks, LLMs are not reliably calibrated for
  requirement-conformance judgement without executing tests. Table 2 shows substantial
  false rejection of correct code (high FNR), even under the minimal Direct prompt, and
  the issue becomes severe under more elaborate prompts. While false acceptance is often
  lower than FNR, it is non-negligible for some model-benchmark pairs (e.g., higher FPR
  on QuixBugs for several models), indicating that correctness judgement from specification
  alone is error-prone and model-dependent.

Open-source models.
The two open-source models present higher error rates and stronger sensitivity to
prompting. Llama-3.1-8B suffers from extremely high FNR across all benchmarks,
indicating severe over-correction: for instance, on MBPP, FNR exceeds 74.7% even
under Direct and rises above 88% under rationale-enabled prompts. QuixBugs also
shows high FNR (52.5%–87.5%), implying that the model rejects a large fraction of
correct solutions when asked to perform requirement-conformance judgement. Mistral-
Small-3.1-24B shows a different failure profile: while its FNR is moderately high across
benchmarks, its FPR can be particularly large on QuixBugs (40.0% under Direct
and Direct+Explain). This suggests that, for certain bug patterns in QuixBugs,
the model frequently accepts buggy code as conformant, highlighting a risk of unsafe
acceptance.

5.2 Error tradeoff
A key observation from Table 2 is that prompt design does not uniformly improve
judgement quality. Instead, increasing prompt complexity often redistributes errors
between FPR and FNR, forming a clear tradeoff for several models. Intuitively,
prompts that ask the model to provide detailed explanations and propose fixes can
encourage model’s reasoning, which may reduce false acceptance but simultaneously
amplify over-correction bias. For GPT-4o, moving from Direct to Direct+Explain
and Full generally decreases FPR while dramatically increasing FNR. The trend
is consistent across all three benchmarks, this indicates a strong prompt-induced
over-correction effect: richer prompts substantially increase rejection of correct imple-
mentations, even though they may also curb false acceptance on buggy ones.
   Claude exhibits a qualitatively similar but milder tradeoff. On HumanEval, FPR
decreases monotonically as prompts become more complex (2.44% to 0.61%), whereas
FNR increases (26.2% to 36.0%). On QuixBugs, the same shift appears (FPR: 5.00%
to 2.50%; FNR: 40.0% to 50.0%). These results indicate that increasing prompt com-
plexity (e.g., explanation- and CoT-style prompting) can indeed elicit deeper auditing
behavior, making LLMs more likely to surface potential issues in the code. However,
this comes with a clear trade-off: the decision boundary shifts toward conservatism,
reducing false acceptance but amplifying over-correction bias and thus
increasing false rejection. Gemini-2.0-flash shows a weaker strictness shift: Full
reduces FPR across benchmarks (e.g., on HumanEval 8.54% to 5.49%), while FNR
increases only moderately from 25.6% to 34.1%.

    3.1-8B.

                    The open-source models show the strongest non-monotonicity and instability. For
    Llama-3.1-8B,                     Direct+Explain sharply increases FNR on all benchmarks (e.g.,
    HumanEval 57.3% to 86.6%; MBPP 74.7% to 91.9%), while FPR may decrease sub-
    stantially in some settings (e.g., QuixBugs 27.5% to 5.00%). However, adding the
    repair step in Full does not consistently improve this trade-off (e.g., on QuixBugs,
    FPR rebounds to 30.0% while FNR remains high at 77.5%). For Mistral-Small-3.1-
    24B, Direct+Explain can even move in the opposite direction on HumanEval by
    increasing FPR (6.71% to 14.6%) while reducing FNR (35.9% to 31.1%).

    Implications.
    The tradeoff in Table 2 is not merely a change in percentages, it translates into sub-
    stantial shifts in the absolute           number of decisions that developers would have to act
    on. Fig 3 makes this operational impact explicit. For GPT-4o, richer prompts largely
    eliminate false acceptance (FP) in some settings (e.g., MBPP FP drops from 19 under
    Direct to 0 under Direct+Explain, staying near-zero under Full), but the same
    change simultaneously more than doubles false rejection of correct code (FN increases
    from 184 to 451 on MBPP). A similar pattern appears on HumanEval (FN 43 to
    120 while FP 4 to 0). This implies that, in practice, explanation and repair-oriented
    prompts reduce the small tail of unsafe acceptances, but at the cost of generating a
    much larger volume of unnecessary rejections and follow-up work, thus increasing the
    verification burden during the software development.

     Answer to RQ2:    Prompt design systematically reshapes the error profile rather than
     uniformly improving judgement quality. As prompts become more detailed, several models
     shift toward conservative rejection: FPR decreases but FNR increases sharply. This trade-
     off is operationally large in absolute terms (Fig. 3), implying frequent decision flips across
     prompting modes and a substantial increase in unnecessary rejections and follow-up work
     when explanations or repairs are required.

                     For the open-source model (Llama-3.1-8B), Fig 3 suggests an even harsher oper-
    ational profile: FN dominates across all modes (e.g., MBPP FN 398 to 490), while
    FP is comparatively smaller and unstable across prompts (MBPP FP 19 to 2). This

tique), Precision Error (numeric precision), Logic Error (algorithmic flaw claim), and

implies that prompt design should be treated as a bias control mechanism rather
than a guaranteed accuracy booster: increasing prompt complexity can easily shift the
model toward conservative rejection, even when it marginally improves safety against
accepting buggy code. Second, the “best” prompt is inherently cost-sensitive: scenar-
ios where false acceptance is unacceptable may intentionally adopt stricter prompts
and tolerate more FN, while scenarios focused on developer throughput and avoiding
unnecessary rework should explicitly control FN and avoid prompts that systematically
inflate overcorrection.

5.3 Sensitivity to bug types
FP analysis is grounded on buggy instances where the injected defect labels (bug type
and failure symptoms) are available. However, to interpret why models become overly
strict (high FNR) or overly permissive (high FPR) under different prompts, it is
equally important to examine the perceived fault types that models cite in their
rationales. In particular, FN cases have no ground-truth defect, so the “bug types”
appearing in FN rationales represent the model’s claimed reasons for rejection.
     As shown in Fig 4 left side, nearly half of FN rationales are attributed to Logic
Error (48.2%, n = 2018 out of 4190), where the model broadly claims the algorithm
is wrong or “missing steps,” often without a falsifiable counterexample. The next
three categories are Added Requirement (14.1%, n = 589), Boundary Error (13.2%,


                                               16










Count

n = 553), and Misread Spec (11.7%, n = 492). Together, these four categories account
for 87.2% of all FN explanations, indicating that over-correction is dominated by
semantic failure modes rather than superficial critique. In contrast, the quality related
categories are comparatively rare: Perf Nitpick (Performance Complexity Nitpick),
Read Nitpick (Style Readability Nitpick), and Precision Error (Numeric Precision)
jointly contribute a small fraction of FN explanations. This suggests that the dominant
over-correction behavior is not simply the model enforcing style, but rather the model
functional mis-calibrating by constructing plausible but unsupported failure bahaviors.
   Fig 4 (right) further breaks down the top-4 perceived errors by model, we observed
that the same four categories (Logic Error, Added Requirement, Boundary Error,
Misread Specification) dominate across all five models, suggesting these are system-
atic failure modes. For example, Logic Error is the top perceived error for every
model (GPT-4o: 470; Claude: 396; Gemini: 220; Llama: 527; Mistral: 405). Second,
open-source and closed-source models exhibit different “over-correction signatures.”
Llama-3.1-8B shows particularly high counts in Logic Error (527) and Added Require-
ment (217), implying a stronger tendency to (i) claim algorithmic flaws, and (ii)
introduce extra unstated constraints when rejecting correct code. GPT-4o, while also
frequently producing Logic Error rationales, shows a comparatively strong presence
of Boundary Error claims (169), consistent with a common pattern where the model
frames correctness around boundary-case reasoning (e.g., < vs. ≤) even when the
implementation is correct. Gemini-2.0-flash has the lowest counts among the five
in these categories (e.g., Misread Spec 47), aligning with its comparatively weaker
strictness shift observed in the error-tradeoff analysis.

  Answer to RQ3: We find recurring and highly concentrated mechanisms behind false
  rejections. By normalizing FN rationales into a unified taxonomy, four dominant patterns
  account for 87.2% of FN explanations: Logic Error (48.2%), Added Requirement (14.1%),
  Boundary Error (13.2%), and Misread Spec (11.7%) (Fig. 4). These results indicate that
  over-correction is primarily driven by unverified claims and requirement hallucination
  (inventing unstated constraints), rather than superficial style critique. For buggy imple-
  mentations, model performance varies strongly by benchmark and model family (Table 2),
  suggesting that false acceptance is sensitive to the bug patterns and oracle strength of each
  benchmark (e.g., QuixBugs exhibits higher and more unstable FPR for several models).

   These findings suggest that both FP and FN analyses should not treat errors
as homogeneous. Instead, the most actionable leverage comes from targeting a small
set of recurrent “fault narratives.” Specifically, the dominance of Logic Error and
Added Requirement indicates that a large portion of rejections are driven by unverified
claims. This motivates mitigation strategies that explicitly force evidence grounding,
for example, requiring the rationale to cite the exact requirement clause
being violated and to provide a concrete counterexample input/output
trace and that discourage unconstrained constraint invention. Likewise, the
prevalence of Boundary Error suggests that models may be over-applying “bug priors”
(boundary mistakes are common in real code) as if they were proof of non-conformance,
motivating prompts that separate “possible risk” from “confirmed violation.”

    Fig. 5: Counts of inconsistent rationales (labeled as contradiction or unclear by a
    GPT-4o evaluator) under rationale-enabled prompts. Bars compare Direct+Explain
    vs. Full for each model across HumanEval, MBPP, and QuixBugs, report absolute

    6 Explanation Reliability
    6.1 A1 Rationale self-consistency
    LLM-based code review tools are typically consumed through explanations rather than
    binary verdicts alone, therefore, beyond judgment correctness, we evaluate whether
    the rationale of a model is internally consistent with its own verdict. In A1, we focus
    on rationale enabled prompting modes (Direct+Explain and            Full) and use a
    GPT-4o evaluator to label each output as consistent, contradiction, or unclear. We
    treat contradiction and unclear as inconsistent rationales, since both reflect unreliable
    explanation quality: contradictions explicitly argue against the verdict, while unclear
    rationales are too vague or mixed to justify the decision.

Inconsistency is non-trivial and benchmark dependent.
Fig 5 reports the number of inconsistent rationales across the three benchmarks.
Overall, inconsistency is not a rare corner case: even strong closed-source models
can produce a noticeable amount of contradiction or unclear rationales [62]. For
instance, GPT-4o shows consistent increases in inconsistency when moving from
Direct+Explain to Full across all benchmarks (HumanEval: 11 → 17, MBPP:
10 → 17, QuixBugs: 3 → 5). Claude-4.5-sonnet exhibits a similar trend, but with a
substantially larger jump on MBPP (60 → 89), indicating that longer, repair-oriented
prompting can destabilize its own justification under more diverse tasks.
    Meanwhile, the effect of adding the repair step is not uniform across mod-
els. Gemini-2.0-flash becomes more self-consistent on HumanEval and MBPP
(HumanEval: 44 → 23, MBPP: 141 → 97), but becomes less self-consistent on
QuixBugs (0 → 8). Open-source models show the clearest dataset sensitivity on
QuixBugs: Llama-3.1’s inconsistency rises from 4 to 16, and Mistral-Small-3.1 rises
from 2 to 18 when switching from Direct+Explain to Full. This is consistent with the
intuition that the carefully crafted prompt introduces additional degrees of freedom
(repair planning and patch justification), which can amplify explanation instability,
especially on small bug-centric benchmarks.

    Fig. 6: Directional breakdown of contradiction cases by model. Each chart shows
    the fraction of Contradiction NO (verdict=NO but rationale positive) vs. Contradic-
    tion YES (verdict=YES but rationale negative), center labels report percentages and
    the total number of contradictions (n).

Contradictions have model-specific directions.
Fig 6 further decomposes contradiction cases into two interpretable types: (i )
Contradiction NO (verdict=NO, but the rationale is positive), and (ii ) Contradic-
tion YES (verdict=YES, but the rationale is negative). We observe a clear directional
asymmetry that varies across model families. For GPT-4o, most contradictions are
Contradiction NO (93%, n=61). In other words, when GPT-4o contradicts itself,
it usually rejects the code even though its explanation reads as if the code should be
accepted. This suggests that under richer prompts, GPT-4o becomes more conserva-
tive in its final verdict, but its explanation does not consistently provide a strong or
concrete reason for rejection.
   In contrast, Gemini-2.0-flash shows the opposite behavior: 88% of contradictions
are Contradiction YES (n=147), it outputs “YES” while simultaneously high-
lighting potential defects. A similar tendency appears in the open-source models
(Llama-3.1: 73% Contradiction YES, n=98; Mistral-Small-3.1: 72% Contradic-
tion YES, n=158). This suggests a pattern that the model preserves an affirmative
verdict but produces a rationale that is not aligned with that verdict, which can be
particularly misleading in practice because it blurs the meaning of a “YES” judgement
[61]. Claude-4.5-sonnet is comparatively more balanced, implying that its inconsis-
tencies arise from both conservative and permissive failure modes. These results
demonstrate that more detailed prompting does not guarantee explanation reliabil-
ity: richer prompts may elicit longer rationales, but do not ensure that the rationale
coherently supports the model’s own verdict. Moreover, the direction of contradic-
tion is model-dependent: GPT-4o tends to reject with supportive rationales, whereas
Gemini and the open-source models tend to accept with fault-claiming rationales, prac-
tically, this undermines the common assumption that “adding explanations increases
trustworthiness.”

    6.2 A2 Fault-awareness
    A2 evaluates whether an LLM’s rationale is fault-aware on buggy instances: when
    the implementation is incorrect, does the explanation correctly describe (i) the bug
    type (root cause category) and (ii) the failure symptoms (observable consequence)?


                                           19

We report match rates (%) between the rationale and ground-truth bug type matched
and failure symptoms matched.

Importantly, A2 does not judge whether the verdict itself is correct instead, it checks
whether the content of the rationale aligns with the ground-truth fault labels.

Symptom awareness is high, bug-type awareness is substantially lower.
Table 3 summarizes A2 match rates under the detailed prompt across three bench-
marks. A consistent pattern emerges across all models and datasets: SymptomMatch
is near-ceiling, while BugMatch is much lower and varies substantially by
benchmark and model. For example, GPT-4o achieves SymptomMatch of 98.2%
(HumanEval), 94.7% (MBPP), and 100.0% (QuixBugs), but its BugMatch is only
59.1%, 70.8%, and 58.3%, respectively, this gap is also visible for the other models.
Open-source models show the same qualitative discrepancy: Llama-3.1 has Symptom-
Match ≥ 96% across benchmarks, yet BugMatch is only 44.2% (HumanEval), 52.2%
(MBPP), and 41.7% (QuixBugs). Taken together, these results indicate that correct
rejection (TN) is frequently driven by symptom-level reasoning (e.g., “this
will produce incorrect output” or “this can fail at runtime”), while cause-level diag-
nosis is much less reliable. Practically, this means that an LLM reviewer can be
“right for the inaccurate reason”: it rejects buggy code correctly, but its explanation
may still mislead debugging by attributing the failure to an incorrect bug category.
Fig 7 shows a concrete example: the rationale correctly identifies the failure symptom
(incorrect output), but mis-classifies the underlying cause by framing it as Missing
Logic even though the ground-truth defect is Value Misuse.

Bug-type breakdown.
To understand why BugMatch is low, we further decompose the bug-type alignment
outcomes (match / mismatch / not mentioned / unclear) by ground-truth bug type in
Fig 8 (aggregated over all benchmarks and models under the Full prompt, restricted
to TN buggy instances). First, bug-type match is highly bug-dependent. Miss-
ing Logic is the easiest category: it reaches 81% match with only 17% mismatch,
suggesting that when the defect is framed as an omission (e.g., missing a required
check or missing a key step) [45, 63], rationales more often converge to the correct
causal description. In contrast, Excess Logic and Operator Misuse show much weaker
alignment: Excess Logic has 55% mismatch, and Operator Misuse is nearly split (46%
mismatch47). Function Misuse is also unstable, although it has the smallest support


 20

                               The code does not meet the requirement. Although the function includes a
                   counter and a loop, it fails to implement the essential digit-counting logic
                   correctly. The termination condition while n != 12 does not ensure that all
                   digits are processed. The correct logic should continue iterating until the
                   number becomes 0, but this condition stops the loop prematurely, meaning     Bug Type Framing
                   the full digit traversal logic is missing.                                      (Misclassified as

                   produces incorrect results for all test cases:
                   - For count_Digit(12345): the loop terminates when n becomes 12 rather
                   than when all digits have been counted, leading to an incorrect result.

 Identification               - For count_Digit(4123459): again, the termination logic prevents complete
                   digit counting.

                            Fig. 7: Example of a symptom is correct but bug type is not matched, the model
                           correctly states the failure symptom, but frames the root cause as Missing Logic
(highlighted in red) instead of the ground-truth Value Misuse.

                         (n = 34), so conclusions for this category should be treated cautiously. Second, low
                               BugMatch is more often caused by misdiagnosis than by silence. Neverthe-
                         less, not mentioned is not negligible for some bug types: Operator Misuse shows the
                         highest not-mentioned proportion (7%), indicating that even in TN cases, a subset of
                      rationales rejects buggy code while failing to explicitly articulate the underlying fault
                        category. This provides direct evidence for our central A2 claim: verdict correctness
does not guarantee fault-aware explanations.
 The A2 results complement our earlier judgement-level bias analysis: while prompt
                         engineering can shift verdict-level behavior, the prompt engineering does not ensure
                         that “more reasoning” yields more diagnostic explanations. Table 3 shows that ratio-
                          nales are generally reliable at stating what goes wrong, but Fig 8 shows that for
                          several bug classes they are much less reliable at stating why it goes wrong, with
                         mismatch being a prevalent failure mode. This mismatch matters for downstream soft-
                         ware engineering workflows: a rationale that correctly flags a defect but attributes
                        it to the wrong cause can still induce ineffective or even harmful repair suggestions,
                          and can waste developer time during debugging [45]. Consequently, A2 suggests that
                         LLM-based code reviewer evaluation should separate decision correctness from expla-
                       nation fault-awareness, and that mitigation efforts should explicitly target cause-level
                        grounding rather than assuming that longer rationales or repair requests automatically
improve diagnosis quality.

 Answer to RQ4:    Explanations elicited by rationale required prompts are not consis-
                    tently reliable. Under A1, we observe non-trivial rates of internally inconsistent rationales
                        (contradiction/unclear), and the contradiction direction is model-dependent. Under A2,
                         rationales are generally strong at describing symptoms but weaker at diagnosing root
                         causes: SymptomMatch is near-ceiling across benchmarks, whereas BugMatch is substan-
                      tially lower and varies by model (Table 3). Overall, longer explanations do not guarantee
                   faithful justification, and correct verdicts can still be paired with misleading bug diagnoses.

7 Bias mitigation exploration
7.1 Setup and strategies
Our earlier results reveal a pronounced over-correction bias under Full prompting:
when asked to (i) judge conformance, (ii) justify, and (iii) propose a fix, LLMs often
become overly conservative and reject correct implementations, leading to a high false-
negative rate, while the false-positive rate is comparatively low. This pattern suggests
that increasing prompt complexity (e.g., explanation and repair-oriented instructions)
can indeed surface more potential issues, but it also shifts the decision boundary
toward stricter rejection, amplifying unnecessary “repair” behaviors.
To mitigate this bias, we introduce a lightweight Fix-guided Verification Filter
(Fig. 9) that sits inside the evaluation pipeline (rather than post-hoc editing stored
predictions). The key intuition is to treat the model’s proposed fix as executable
evidence: if a model says NO and proposes a patch, then the pair (original code, fix
code ) forms a natural counterfactual for verification. Instead of trusting the textual
rationale, we validate both programs with runtime evidence using (1) the benchmark’s
reference test suite and (2) a spec-constrained augmented test suite generated by GPT-
4o. This design is inspired by the “generate-and-validate” philosophy in test suite
based program repair and execution guided verification, where candidate changes are
accepted only when they withstand behavioral checks, while also aligning with recent
self-refinement or feedback-based LLM frameworks that leverage external signals to
correct model behaviors [39, 40].

         with a proposed fix, we execute both the original and fixed implementations on the
         benchmark tests and generated spec-constrained tests, and update the final verdict
    according to four executable cases.

    Filter decision cases.
          Given an input program c and a proposed fix ˆc (extracted from the response), the
    filter executes both against the benchmark test cases T   and an augmented test set T˜.
    The final verdict is determined by four common outcomes:
    • Case 1 (equivalent): c and ˆc         both pass, and they are behaviorally consistent
          (same outputs) on spec-constrained augmented inputs T˜. This indicates the fix is
     unnecessary, we treat the original decision as over-correction and flip the verdict to
     YES.
     • Case 2 (both fail): both c and ˆc fail on the augmented tests, suggesting either the
         augmentation over-extended the spec or the repair is still incorrect. We fall back
     to the benchmark tests only and allow up to K          re-judge rounds, where the next
     judgment is conditioned on previously failed tests to guide refinement, if the process
     remains unresolved after K rounds, we keep the original verdict.
         • Case 3 (over-repair): c passes but ˆc fails, meaning the proposed fix introduces
     regressions, we interpret this as over-repair and flip to YES.
      • Case 4 (repair success): c fails but ˆc passes, indicating the fix corrects genuine
     nonconformance, we keep the original verdict.

Implementation setup.
The filter is applied only when the judge returns NO and provides a fix. All five models
(GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-4.5-sonnet, Llama-3.1-8B, and Mistral-Small-3.1-
24B) produce the initial verdict and fix, while the augmented test generation step is
standardized to GPT-4o to ensure consistent filtering across judge models. Augmented
tests are explicitly constrained by the task specification and examples to avoid intro-
ducing adversarial requirements, in our experiments we use K =2 rounds, and cache
augmented tests to improve reproducibility and robustness.

7.2 Result and Analysis
Table 4 reports FPR/FNR before vs. after applying the Fix-guided Verification Filter
under Full prompting. Averaged across models, FNR drops from 54.8% to 16.3% on
HumanEval and 69.0% to 28.9% on MBPP, while QuixBugs also improves (51.0% to
24.0%). Notably, the gains are strongest for models with extreme baseline conservatism
under the Full setup, e.g., Llama-3.1-8B on MBPP (90.81%→23.56%) and GPT-4o on
MBPP (88.74%→39.96%), demonstrating that the filter can substantially counteract
prompt-induced strictness.
The observed improvements are aligned with the mechanism of the filter: when
an LLM proposes a fix for a correct program, that fix often does not introduce new
behavior, by requiring the original and fixed code to be consistent under executable
tests (including spec-constrained augmentation), the filter rejects spurious NO deci-
sions and recovers correct YES outcomes. Conceptually, this resembles “execution as
an arbiter” and “patch validation” in test-driven repair, where runtime evidence is
used to gate model-driven changes and avoid unnecessary edits. In our setting, the
same idea serves as a bias mitigation tool: it converts the model’s own patch into a ver-
ifiable hypothesis and uses differential evidence to decide whether the initial rejection
was warranted. While the filter is designed primarily to mitigate over-correction bias,


24

FPR can increase slightly after filtering (e.g., GPT-4o on HumanEval: 0.00%→1.83%;
several models on QuixBugs: +2.5 points). This is expected: the filter is triggered
only on NO+fix cases, and flipping some of these rejections to YES can inadver-
tently accept a small number of buggy programs that pass limited tests. This effect is
most visible on QuixBugs, where the reference test suites are often shallow, reducing
the discriminative power of execution-based checks; even spec-constrained augmen-
tation cannot fully compensate for missing oracle coverage. Practically, this suggests
the filter is most reliable when the benchmark harness provides reasonable behav-
ioral coverage (as in HumanEval/MBPP), and it motivates future extensions such
as stronger augmentation (e.g., metamorphic relations or property-based generators),
multi-oracle agreement, or combining execution evidence with lightweight static checks
to further limit residual false acceptances. Overall, Table 4 shows that the Fix-guided
Verification Filter provides a simple and model-agnostic way to substantially reduce
over-correction bias under Full prompting, by grounding verdict revision in executable
evidence rather than purely textual rationales.

  Answer to RQ5: False rejection of correct code is primarily caused by prompt-induced
  conservatism and rationale-driven overreach: models frequently hallucinate extra con-
  straints, over-emphasize edge cases, or assert vague “logic errors” without executable
  evidence (Fig. 4). To mitigate this over-correction bias, we introduce a Fix-guided Verifica-
  tion Filter that treats the model-proposed fix as an executable counterfactual and validates
  under benchmark and spec-constrained augmented tests (Fig. 9). The filter substantially
  reduces FNR across all five models and three benchmarks, with only modest FPR increases
  in some settings, this suggests misjudgments can be mitigated by grounding decisions in
  executable evidence rather than relying solely on increasingly elaborate prompts.

8 Threats to Validity

This section discusses limitations and potential confounding factors in our experi-
mental design and the proposed Fix-guided Verification Filter, organized following
common validity dimensions.

8.1 Construct Validity
A central construct in our study is over-correction (rejecting correct implementa-
tions), which is closely related to but not identical to LLMs hallucination [11]. Many
false rejections are accompanied by confident rationales that introduce unstated con-
straints or speculative failure scenarios, which resembles requirement hallucination in
natural-language generation. However, our current analysis does not explicitly align
the taxonomy of FN rationales with established hallucination definitions and mea-
surements (e.g., intrinsic vs. extrinsic hallucination) [64]. Consequently, some of the
observed misjudgments may be partially explained by broader hallucination behav-
iors rather than a unique code-review specific bias. Future work could bridge this gap
by jointly evaluating FN rationales with hallucination-oriented metrics and annotator
guidelines, and by explicitly modeling whether each rejection claim is supported by
the given specification.



    25

   Operationalization of correctness via benchmark labels and tests. We
treat canonical solutions as correct (label = 1) and buggy solutions as incorrect (label
= 0), and compute FNR/FPR accordingly. While this paired design enables con-
trolled comparisons, it assumes that canonical solutions and embedded tests reflect the
intended specification. In practice, benchmark tests can be incomplete, and canonical
solutions may encode one of several valid behaviors consistent with the natural-
language requirement. As a result, a model may be penalized for rejecting a canonical
implementation due to an alternative (but still plausible) spec interpretation, or a
buggy implementation may slip through weak tests and appear acceptable. This is
particularly salient for small suites (e.g., QuixBugs), where limited oracle coverage
can blur the boundary between functional non-conformance and under-specification.
   Prompt-mode construct and interpretation. Our three prompting modes
(Direct, Direct+Explain, Full) are meant to represent progressively richer
reviewer instructions. Still, prompt semantics can implicitly signal different review
criteria (e.g., encouraging best-practice critique or performance concerns) even when
not required by the task [65]. Therefore, part of the measured “bias shift” may reflect
a change in the latent evaluation rubric induced by the prompt, rather than a pure
reasoning-quality change.

8.2 Internal Validity
Sensitivity to prompt wording and formatting. Results can change with prompt
phrasing. Although we use common, widely adopted prompt patterns, minor changes
(e.g., stricter instruction to ignore efficiency, different formatting of requirements/code
blocks, or alternative delimiters) can alter the model’s decision boundary and thus
the measured FNR/FPR. This introduces a threat that some effects may be prompt-
instance specific, a stronger design would include multiple paraphrased prompts per
mode and report variance (or worst/best-case bounds) across prompt templates.
   Non-determinism and API/runtime variability. Even with temperature
= 0, model-serving infrastructure can introduce slight non-determinism (e.g., backend
updates, routing, transient failures). Additionally, tool-chain details (Python version,
timeouts, process isolation) may affect whether executions terminate or time out,
which can influence filter decisions. We partially mitigate this by logging raw out-
puts, caching augmented tests, and using consistent execution budgets, but residual
nondeterminism may still affect edge cases.
   Verification is only as strong as the tests. The Fix-guided Verification Filter
relies on the benchmark test suite plus GPT-generated spec-constrained augmenta-
tions. If the augmented tests fail to cover the relevant behavioral space, the filter may
incorrectly treat two implementations as behaviorally equivalent (Case 1) or accept a
buggy implementation that still passes the available tests. This is a key reason why
mitigation can reduce FNR substantially while sometimes slightly increasing FPR:
flipping some NO to YES decisions can inadvertently pass buggy code under insuffi-
cient test coverage, this is an inherent limitation of execution-based validation without
a formal oracle.




    26

   Evaluator coupling and potential judge bias in augmentation. Although
the initial verdicts and fixes come from five different judge models, the augmenta-
tion step is standardized to GPT-4o. This improves consistency between conditions,
but introduces dependency on a single model’s prior testing. If GPT-4o systemat-
ically under-generates certain edge cases, the filter may overestimate equivalence.
Conversely, if it over-generates constraints, the filter may become overly strict. A
more robust alternative would triangulate augmentation using multiple generators or
incorporate metamorphic relations or property-based testing.

8.3 External Validity
Generalizability beyond benchmark Python functions. HumanEval, MBPP,
and QuixBugs contain relatively small, self-contained functions with short specifica-
tions and unit-test harnesses. Real-world code review often involves larger codebases,
hidden dependencies, stateful APIs, and non-functional requirements (performance,
security, maintainability), therefore, the measured bias patterns and the effectiveness
of the filter may not directly transfer to industrial settings.
   Model coverage and version drift. We evaluate five representative LLMs (three
closed-source and two open-source). Closed-source models evolve rapidly, so measured
rates may change as providers update models. For open-source models, alternative
instruction-tuned variants or larger parameter scales may exhibit different bias profiles.
While we report results for a diverse set of models, the findings should be interpreted
as evidence about these specific model snapshots rather than immutable properties of
the families.

9 Conclusion

In this paper, we revisits whether a model can reliably judge requirement confor-
mance from a natural-language specification and an implementation without executing
tests. Through a unified evaluation on three widely used benchmarks and five rep-
resentative LLMs, we uncover a systematic reliability gap: models frequently reject
correct implementations, and this over-correction tendency can become substantially
worse as prompts are enriched with explanation and repair requirements. Our results
demonstrate that prompt “enhancements” often act as a decision-boundary control
rather than a guaranteed accuracy booster. In particular, explanation and fix-oriented
prompting can sharply increase false rejections while reducing false acceptances, pro-
ducing a pronounced trade-off that also translates into large operational costs in
absolute FN/FP counts. Beyond verdict accuracy, we show that rationales are not
consistently trustworthy: models can produce internally inconsistent explanations and
exhibit high symptom-level but weaker cause-level fault awareness, implying that
persuasive rationales may still be unfaithful or diagnostically misleading. To miti-
gate over-correction bias, we propose a Fix-guided Verification Filter that treats the
model’s proposed fix as executable counterfactual evidence and validates the original
vs. fix behavior in augmented tests with restrictions on parameters and specifications.
This lightweight framework reduces false-negative rates across all tested models and
benchmarks, with only modest increases in false-positive rates in some settings.
